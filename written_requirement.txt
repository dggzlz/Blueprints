Assignment 4 Written Requirement Response

Student Name(s): Diego Gonzalez Reyes

1. Describe two challenges that the format of the building file presented.

    The first challenge that the building presented was the way to represent the building in a 2D list.
    opening the file and read it was easy, but to have those lines represented as a 2D list was harder. 
    the hard part was getting everything in one line and then separate it by the \n character. 
    For some reason though, it wouldn't work at first. the solution was to not treat it as one line, but,
    multiple lines that I iterate through. Going line by line it was easier to split the line into a list 
    and then append that list into a bigger list.

    The second challenge was to put back the building as originally. I thought by just joining the lists I
    would get the building format back, but instead I got a mess. I had to iterate by row, to join the 
    whole row(list) into one string, and then finally just join the list with \n into a bigger string. 

    These challenges were quite hard specially because I've never work with files before.

2.Briefly describe an alternative file format that would not pose the challenges you provided in 1.
    By just writing the file in one line, separated by commas each die then I'd just need to split 
    by commasand I wouldn't need to have a whole function to just represent that as a list, but 
    rather a few lines of code to represent it as a list.

3.Briefly describe a different challenge that your alternative file format would pose.
    If I want to represent it as a 2D list, then how to divide the line by 3 stacks would be hard, since is 
    already one single list.
